# Products_Management_Project
This is a web-based application built using ASP.NET Core MVC and SQL Server for efficiently managing products such as laptops, mobiles, and cameras.
The system allows users to add, edit, delete, and view products with a structured database and user-friendly interface.
It follows MVC architecture to ensure clean code separation and scalability.
The project also integrates CRUD operations with SQL Server, making it a robust solution for managing product inventories.


Thank You...
